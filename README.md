This Java application,  CityRoadNetwork , simulates a road network, allowing users to add cities and roads, display the network's structure, and (in a future, more complete version) find the shortest route between two cities using a shortest path algorithm (currently a placeholder).  Created as a learning exercise to demonstrate graph data structures and algorithms, it uses a HashMap to represent the adjacency list of the graph, providing a clear and efficient way to store and access network information.  Its contribution lies in serving as a foundational learning tool for students and anyone interested in data structures and algorithms, providing a stepping stone towards more complex applications like route planners or network simulators by implementing more advanced algorithms like Dijkstra's for shortest path finding.
